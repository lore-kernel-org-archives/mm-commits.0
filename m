The patch titled
     ext3 balloc: fix off-by-one against grp_goal
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-balloc-fix-off-by-one-against-grp_goal.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext3 balloc: fix off-by-one against grp_goal
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

grp_goal 0 is a genuine goal (unlike -1), so ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv
should treat it as such.
