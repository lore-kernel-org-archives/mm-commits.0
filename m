The patch titled
     ext3: fix setup_new_group_blocks locking
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-fix-setup_new_group_blocks-locking.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext3: fix setup_new_group_blocks locking
From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

setup_new_group_blocks() manipulates the group descriptor block bh under
the block_bitmap bh's lock.  It shouldn't matter since nobody but resize
should be touching these blocks, but it's worth fixing up.
