The patch titled
     Subject: memcg: convert mem_cgroup->under_oom from atomic_t to int
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     memcg-convert-mem_cgroup-under_oom-from-atomic_t-to-int.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

Subject: memcg: convert mem_cgroup->under_oom from atomic_t to int

memcg->under_oom tracks whether the memcg is under OOM conditions and is
an atomic_t counter managed with mem_cgroup_[un]mark_under_oom().  While
atomic_t appears to be simple synchronization-wise, when used as a
synchronization construct like here, it's trickier and more error-prone
due to weak memory ordering rules, especially around atomic_read(), and
false sense of security.

For example, both non-trivial read sites of memcg->under_oom are a bit
problematic although not being actually broken.

* mem_cgroup_oom_register_event()

  It isn't explicit what guarantees the memory ordering between event
  addition and memcg->under_oom check.  This isn't broken only because
  memcg_oom_lock is used for both event list and memcg->oom_lock.

* memcg_oom_recover()

  The lockless test doesn't have any explanation why this would be
  safe.

mem_cgroup_[un]mark_under_oom() are very cold paths and there's no point
in avoiding locking memcg_oom_lock there.  This patch converts
memcg->under_oom from atomic_t to int, puts their modifications under
memcg_oom_lock and documents why the lockless test in memcg_oom_recover()
is safe.
