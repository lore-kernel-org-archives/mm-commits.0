The quilt patch titled
     Subject: minmax.h: update some comments
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     minmaxh-update-some-comments.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-nonmm-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

From: David Laight <David.Laight@ACULAB.COM>
Subject: minmax.h: update some comments
Date: Mon, 18 Nov 2024 19:12:07 +0000

- Change three to several.
- Remove the comment about retaining constant expressions, no longer true.
- Realign to nearer 80 columns and break on major punctiation.
- Add a leading comment to the block before __signed_type() and __is_nonneg()
  Otherwise the block explaining the cast is a bit 'floating'.
  Reword the rest of that comment to improve readability.
