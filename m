There's a bug in the gdth rework in that the instance can be deleted
from the list before the actual timer is stopped.  This can be worked
around I think by the following patch; although we really should be
stopping the timer from firing when the list goes empty.


James said:

This is almost certainly the wrong fix for real hardware.  Although it
kills the timer when the list goes empty, nothing will ever restart it
when the list fills again.

Boaz, since you touched all of this, you get to fix it.  The correct fix
will be to control the timer along with the actual list instead of at
entry/exit time.  If you're not going to add this empty check to the
timer routine, make sure you use del_timer_sync() before removing the
last element from the list.
