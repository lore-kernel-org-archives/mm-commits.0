The patch titled
     Subject: dax: relocate some dax functions
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     dax-relocate-some-dax-functions.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
From: Ross Zwisler <ross.zwisler@linux.intel.com>
Subject: dax: relocate some dax functions

dax_load_hole() will soon need to call dax_insert_mapping_entry(), so it
needs to be moved lower in dax.c so the definition exists.

dax_wake_mapping_entry_waiter() will soon be removed from dax.h and be
made static to dax.c, so we need to move its definition above all its
callers.
