Subject: ext3/4: fix uninitialized bs in ext3/4_xattr_set_handle()
From: Tiger Yang <tiger.yang@oracle.com>

This fix the uninitialized bs when we try to replace a xattr entry in
ibody with the new value which require more than free space.

This situation only happens we format ext3/4 with inode size more than 128 and
we have put xattr entries both in ibody and block.  The consequences about
this bug is we will lost the xattr block which pointed by i_file_acl with all
xattr entires in it.  We will alloc a new xattr block and put that large value
entry in it.  The old xattr block will become orphan block.
