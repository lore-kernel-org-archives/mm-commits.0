Subject: scsi: update drivers & tools URL references
From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>

Change torque.net references for SCSI drivers & tools to their current
locations (sg.danny.cz/sg).  Remove whitespace at ends of lines.

Same could be done for parport references at torque.net except that those
files don't seem to have a home now.
