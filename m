Subject: kasan: docs: update tests section

Update the "Tests" section in KASAN documentation:

- Add an introductory sentence.
- Add proper indentation for the list of ways to run KUnit tests.
- Punctuation, readability, and other minor clean-ups.

 There are a few ways to run KUnit-compatible KASAN tests.
 
 1. Loadable module
 
-With ``CONFIG_KUNIT`` enabled, ``CONFIG_KASAN_KUNIT_TEST`` can be built as
-a loadable module and run on any architecture that supports KASAN by loading
-the module with insmod or modprobe. The module is called ``test_kasan``.

 2. Built-In
 
-With ``CONFIG_KUNIT`` built-in, ``CONFIG_KASAN_KUNIT_TEST`` can be built-in
-on any architecure that supports KASAN. These and any other KUnit tests enabled
