Subject: mm: allow CONFIG_MIGRATION to be set without CONFIG_NUMA or memory hot-remove
From: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

CONFIG_MIGRATION currently depends on CONFIG_NUMA or on the architecture
being able to hot-remove memory.  The main users of page migration such as
sys_move_pages(), sys_migrate_pages() and cpuset process migration are
only beneficial on NUMA so it makes sense.

As memory compaction will operate within a zone and is useful on both NUMA
and non-NUMA systems, this patch allows CONFIG_MIGRATION to be set if the
user selects CONFIG_COMPACTION as an option.
