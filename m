Subject: ext3: validate directory entry data before use
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

ext3_dx_find_entry uses ext3_next_entry without verifying that the entry
is valid.  If its rec_len == 0 this causes an infinite loop.  Refactor the
loop to check the validity of entries before checking whether they match
and moving onto the next one.

There are other uses of ext3_next_entry in this file which also look
problematic.  They should be reviewed and fixed if/when we have a
test-case that triggers them.

This patch fixes the first case (image hdb.25.softlockup.gz) reported in
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10882.
