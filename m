Subject: vfs: pagecache usage optimization for pagesize!=blocksize
From: Hisashi Hifumi <hifumi.hisashi@oss.ntt.co.jp>

When we read some part of a file through pagecache, if there is a
pagecache of corresponding index but this page is not uptodate, read IO is
issued and this page will be uptodate.

I think this is good for pagesize == blocksize environment but there is
room for improvement on pagesize != blocksize environment.  Because in
this case a page can have multiple buffers and even if a page is not
uptodate, some buffers can be uptodate.

So I suggest that when all buffers which correspond to a part of a file
that we want to read are uptodate, use this pagecache and copy data from
this pagecache to user buffer even if a page is not uptodate.  This can
reduce read IO and improve system throughput.
