The patch titled
     vfs: pagecache usage optimization for pagesize!=blocksize
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     vfs-pagecache-usage-optimization-onpagesize=blocksize-environment.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: vfs: pagecache usage optimization for pagesize!=blocksize
From: Hisashi Hifumi <hifumi.hisashi@oss.ntt.co.jp>

When we read some part of a file through pagecache, if there is a
pagecache of corresponding index but this page is not uptodate, read IO is
issued and this page will be uptodate.

I think this is good for pagesize == blocksize environment but there is
room for improvement on pagesize != blocksize environment.  Because in
this case a page can have multiple buffers and even if a page is not
uptodate, some buffers can be uptodate.

So I suggest that when all buffers which correspond to a part of a file
that we want to read are uptodate, use this pagecache and copy data from
this pagecache to user buffer even if a page is not uptodate.  This can
reduce read IO and improve system throughput.

I wrote a benchmark program and got result number with this program.

This benchmark do:

  1: mount and open a test file.

  2: create a 512MB file.

  3: close a file and umount.

  4: mount and again open a test file.

  5: pwrite randomly 300000 times on a test file.  offset is aligned
     by IO size(1024bytes).

  6: measure time of preading randomly 100000 times on a test file.

The result was:
	2.6.26
        330 sec

	2.6.26-patched
        226 sec

Arch:i386 
Filesystem:ext3
Blocksize:1024 bytes
Memory: 1GB

On ext3/4, a file is written through buffer/block.  So random read/write
mixed workloads or random read after random write workloads are optimized
with this patch under pagesize != blocksize environment.  This test result
showed this.


The benchmark program is as follows:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/mount.h>

#define LEN 1024
#define LOOP 1024*512 /* 512MB */

main(void)
{
	unsigned long i, offset, filesize;
	int fd;
	char buf[LEN];
	time_t t1, t2;

	if (mount("/dev/sda1", "/root/test1/", "ext3", 0, 0) < 0) {
		perror("cannot mount\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	memset(buf, 0, LEN);
	fd = open("/root/test1/testfile", O_CREAT|O_RDWR|O_TRUNC);
	if (fd < 0) {
		perror("cannot open file\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	for (i = 0; i < LOOP; i++)
		write(fd, buf, LEN);
	close(fd);
	if (umount("/root/test1/") < 0) {
		perror("cannot umount\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	if (mount("/dev/sda1", "/root/test1/", "ext3", 0, 0) < 0) {
		perror("cannot mount\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	fd = open("/root/test1/testfile", O_RDWR);
	if (fd < 0) {
		perror("cannot open file\n");
		exit(1);
	}

	filesize = LEN * LOOP;
	for (i = 0; i < 300000; i++){
		offset = (random() % filesize) & (~(LEN - 1));
		pwrite(fd, buf, LEN, offset);
	}
	printf("start test\n");
	time(&t1);
	for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++){
		offset = (random() % filesize) & (~(LEN - 1));
		pread(fd, buf, LEN, offset);
	}
	time(&t2);
	printf("%ld sec\n", t2-t1);
	close(fd);
	if (umount("/root/test1/") < 0) {
		perror("cannot umount\n");
		exit(1);
	}
