The patch titled
     ext3 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was

Subject: ext3 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

Port fix to the off-by-one in find_next_usable_block's memscan from ext2 to
ext3; but it didn't cause a serious problem for ext3 because the additional
ext3_test_allocatable check rescued it from the error.
