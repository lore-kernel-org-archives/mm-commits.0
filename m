has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     r-o-bind-mounts-stub-functions.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be merged

Subject: r-o-bind-mounts: stub functions
From: Dave Hansen <haveblue@us.ibm.com>

This patch adds two function mnt_want_write() and mnt_drop_write().  These are
used like a lock pair around and fs operations that might cause a write to the
filesystem.

Before these can become useful, we must first cover each place in the VFS
where writes are performed with a want/drop pair.  When that is complete, we
can actually introduce code that will safely check the counts before allowing
r/w<->r/o transitions to occur.
