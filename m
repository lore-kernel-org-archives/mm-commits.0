The patch titled
     cgroups: make procs file writable
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     cgroups-make-procs-file-writable.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: cgroups: make procs file writable
From: Ben Blum <bblum@andrew.cmu.edu>

Make procs file writable to move all threads by tgid at once.

Add functionality that enables users to move all threads in a threadgroup
at once to a cgroup by writing the tgid to the 'cgroup.procs' file.  This
current implementation makes use of a per-threadgroup rwsem that's taken
for reading in the fork() path to prevent newly forking threads within the
threadgroup from "escaping" while the move is in progress.
