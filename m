The patch titled
     Subject: mm: add definition of PMD_PAGE_ORDER
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-add-definition-of-pmd_page_order.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be merged

------------------------------------------------------
From: Mike Rapoport <rppt@linux.ibm.com>
Subject: mm: add definition of PMD_PAGE_ORDER

Patch series "mm: introduce memfd_secret system call to create "secret" memory areas", v6.

This is an implementation of "secret" mappings backed by a file
descriptor.  I've dropped the boot time reservation patch for now as it is
not strictly required for the basic usage and can be easily added later
either with or without CMA.

The file descriptor backing secret memory mappings is created using a
dedicated memfd_secret system call The desired protection mode for the
memory is configured using flags parameter of the system call.  The mmap()
of the file descriptor created with memfd_secret() will create a "secret"
memory mapping.  The pages in that mapping will be marked as not present
in the direct map and will have desired protection bits set in the user
page table.  For instance, current implementation allows uncached
mappings.

Although normally Linux userspace mappings are protected from other users,
such secret mappings are useful for environments where a hostile tenant is
trying to trick the kernel into giving them access to other tenants
mappings.

Additionally, the secret mappings may be used as a mean to protect guest
memory in a virtual machine host.

For demonstration of secret memory usage we've created a userspace library
[1] that does two things: the first is act as a preloader for openssl to
redirect all the OPENSSL_malloc calls to secret memory meaning any secret
keys get automatically protected this way and the other thing it does is
expose the API to the user who needs it.  We anticipate that a lot of the
use cases would be like the openssl one: many toolkits that deal with
secret keys already have special handling for the memory to try to give
them greater protection, so this would simply be pluggable into the
toolkits without any need for user application modification.

I've hesitated whether to continue to use new flags to memfd_create() or
to add a new system call and I've decided to use a new system call after
I've started to look into man pages update.  There would have been two
completely independent descriptions and I think it would have been very
confusing.

Hiding secret memory mappings behind an anonymous file allows (ab)use of
the page cache for tracking pages allocated for the "secret" mappings as
well as using address_space_operations for e.g.  page migration callbacks.

The anonymous file may be also used implicitly, like hugetlb files, to
implement mmap(MAP_SECRET) and use the secret memory areas with "native"
mm ABIs in the future.

As the fragmentation of the direct map was one of the major concerns
raised during the previous postings, I've added an amortizing cache of
PMD-size pages to each file descriptor that is used as an allocation pool
for the secret memory areas.

This patch (of 6):

The definition of PMD_PAGE_ORDER denoting the number of base pages in the
second-level leaf page is already used by DAX and maybe handy in other
cases as well.

Several architectures already have definition of PMD_ORDER as the size of
second level page table, so to avoid conflict with these definitions use
PMD_PAGE_ORDER name and update DAX respectively.
