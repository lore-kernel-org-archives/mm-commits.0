The patch titled
     retries in ext3_prepare_write() violate ordering requirements
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     retries-in-ext3_prepare_write-violate-ordering-requirements.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: retries in ext3_prepare_write() violate ordering requirements
From: Andrey Savochkin <saw@sw.ru>

In journal=ordered or journal=data mode retry in ext3_prepare_write()
breaks the requirements of journaling of data with respect to metadata. 
The fix is to call commit_write to commit allocated zero blocks before
retry.
