The patch titled
     Subject: mm, compaction: skip rechecks when lock was already held
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-compaction-skip-rechecks-when-lock-was-already-held.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

From: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>
Subject: mm, compaction: skip rechecks when lock was already held

Compaction scanners try to lock zone locks as late as possible by checking
many page or pageblock properties opportunistically without lock and
skipping them if not unsuitable.  For pages that pass the initial checks,
some properties have to be checked again safely under lock.  However, if
the lock was already held from a previous iteration in the initial checks,
the rechecks are unnecessary.

This patch therefore skips the rechecks when the lock was already held. 
This is now possible to do, since we don't (potentially) drop and
reacquire the lock between the initial checks and the safe rechecks
anymore.
