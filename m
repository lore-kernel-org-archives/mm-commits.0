The patch titled
     ext3: tighten restrictions on inode flags
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-tighten-restrictions-on-inode-flags.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext3: tighten restrictions on inode flags
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

At the moment there are few restrictions on which flags may be set on
which inodes.  Specifically DIRSYNC may only be set on directories and
IMMUTABLE and APPEND may not be set on links.  Tighten that to disallow
TOPDIR being set on non-directories and only NODUMP and NOATIME to be set
on non-regular file, non-directories.

Introduces a flags masking function which masks flags based on mode and
use it during inode creation and when flags are set via the ioctl to
facilitate future consistency.
