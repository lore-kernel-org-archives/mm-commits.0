The patch titled
     ext[234]: fix comment for nonexistent variable
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext-fix-comment-for-nonexistent-variable.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext[234]: fix comment for nonexistent variable
From: Akinobu Mita <akinobu.mita@gmail.com>

The comment in ext[234]_new_blocks() describes about "i".  But there is no
local variable called "i" in that scope.  I guess it has been renamed to
group_no.
