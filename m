Subject: fiemap: fix problem with setting FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST
From: Josef Bacik <jbacik@redhat.com>

Fix a problem where the generic block based fiemap stuff would not
properly set FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST on the last extent.  I've reworked things
to keep track if we go past the EOF, and mark the last extent properly. 
The problem was reported by and tested by Eric Sandeen.
