The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm/collapse: open-code collapse_single_pmd() in its two callers
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-collapse-open-code-collapse_single_pmd-in-its-two-callers.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be issued

Subject: mm/collapse: open-code collapse_single_pmd() in its two callers
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2026 13:02:29 +0100

collapse_scan_pmd() and collapse_run_pmd() each have a clear locking
contract.  The scan is called with mmap_lock held for reading and returns
with it still held.  The collapse is called without it.

collapse_single_pmd() kept that boundary inside itself.  It dropped the
lock on some paths and not others, and reported which by way of a bool its
callers had to carry along and then act on.

Open-code it in the two callers.  Each scans under the lock it already
holds and, on SCAN_SUCCEED, gives the lock up before running the collapse.
khugepaged's lock_dropped and madvise_collapse()'s mmap_unlocked both go:
the code dropping the lock is now the code that wanted to know.

khugepaged's walk carries on to the next table while the scan keeps
refusing, and ends once a collapse has taken the lock from under it. 
madvise_collapse() re-finds its VMA after a collapse, which it did before,
and now uses a NULL vma to say that it has to.  It still reports the drop
to its own caller, from the line that does it.

The lock is given up and taken again at the same points as before.  No
functional change.
