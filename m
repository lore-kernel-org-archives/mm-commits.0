From: Huang Shijie <shijie.huang@arm.com>
Subject: mm/hugetlb.c: rename some allocation functions

After a future patch, the __alloc_buddy_huge_page() will not necessarily
use the buddy allocator.

So this patch removes the "buddy" from these functions:
	__alloc_buddy_huge_page -> __alloc_huge_page
	__alloc_buddy_huge_page_no_mpol -> __alloc_huge_page_no_mpol
	__alloc_buddy_huge_page_with_mpol -> __alloc_huge_page_with_mpol

This patch makes preparation for the later patch.
