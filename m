The patch titled
     Subject: memcg: per-memcg kmem shrinking
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     memcg-per-memcg-kmem-shrinking.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be merged

------------------------------------------------------
From: Glauber Costa <glommer@openvz.org>
Subject: memcg: per-memcg kmem shrinking

If the kernel limit is smaller than the user limit, we will have
situations in which our allocations fail but freeing user pages will buy
us nothing.  In those, we would like to call a specialized memcg reclaimer
that only frees kernel memory and leave the user memory alone.  Those are
also expected to fail when we account memcg->kmem, instead of when we
account memcg->res.  Based on that, this patch implements a memcg-specific
reclaimer, that only shrinks kernel objects, withouth touching user pages.

There might be situations in which there are plenty of objects to shrink,
but we can't do it because the __GFP_FS flag is not set.  Although they
can happen with user pages, they are a lot more common with fs-metadata:
this is the case with almost all inode allocation.

Those allocations are, however, capable of waiting.  So we can just span a
worker, let it finish its job and proceed with the allocation.  As slow as
it is, at this point we are already past any hopes anyway.
