The patch titled
     ext3/4: don't do orphan processing on readonly devices
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-4-dont-do-orphan-processing-on-readonly-devices.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

Subject: ext3/4: don't do orphan processing on readonly devices
From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

If you do something like:

# touch foo
# tail -f foo &
# rm foo
# <take snapshot>
# <mount snapshot>

you'll panic, because ext3/4 tries to do orphan list processing on the
readonly snapshot device, and:

kernel: journal commit I/O error
kernel: Assertion failure in journal_flush_Rsmp_e2f189ce() at journal.c:1356: "!journal->j_checkpoint_transactions"
kernel: Kernel panic: Fatal exception

for a truly readonly underlying device, it's reasonable and necessary
to just skip orphan list processing.
