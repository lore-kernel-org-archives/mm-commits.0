The patch titled
     ext4: fix mount option parsing
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext4-fix-mount-option-parsing.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext4: fix mount option parsing
From: Josef Bacik <jbacik@redhat.com>

The "resize" option won't be noticed as it comes after the NULL option, so if
you try to mount (or in this case remount) with that option it won't be
recognized.
