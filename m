Subject: drivers/base/memory: don't store phys_device in memory blocks

No need to store the value for each and every memory block, as we can
easily query the value at runtime.  Reshuffle the members to optimize the
memory layout.  Also, let's clarify what the interface once was used for
and why it's legacy nowadays.

"phys_device" was used on s390x in older versions of lsmem[2]/chmem[3],
back when they were still part of s390x-tools.  They were later replaced
by the variants in linux-utils.  For example, RHEL6 and RHEL7 contain
lsmem/chmem from s390-utils.  RHEL8 switched to versions from util-linux
on s390x [4].

"phys_device" was added with sysfs support for memory hotplug in commit
3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH] memory hotplug: sysfs and add/remove functions") in
2005.  It always returned 0.

s390x started returning something != 0 on some setups (if sclp.rzm is set
by HW) in 2010 via commit 57b552ba0b2f ("memory hotplug/s390: set
phys_device").

For s390x, it allowed for identifying which memory block devices belong to
the same storage increment (RZM).  Only if all memory block devices
comprising a single storage increment were offline, the memory could
actually be removed in the hypervisor.

Since commit e5d709bb5fb7 ("s390/memory hotplug: provide
memory_block_size_bytes() function") in 2013 a memory block device spans
at least one storage increment - which is why the interface isn't really
helpful/used anymore (except by old lsmem/chmem tools).

There were once RFC patches to make use of "phys_device" in ACPI context;
however, the underlying problem could be solved using different interfaces
[1].
