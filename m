The patch titled
     ext3, ext4: avoid divide by zero
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-ext4-avoid-divide-by-zero.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext3, ext4: avoid divide by zero
From: "Andries E. Brouwer" <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>

As it turns out, the kernel divides by EXT3_INODES_PER_GROUP(s) when
mounting an ext3 filesystem.  If that number is zero, a crash follows. 
Below a patch.

This crash was reported by Joeri de Ruiter, Carst Tankink and Pim Vullers.
