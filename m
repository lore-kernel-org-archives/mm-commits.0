Subject: ext3: return after ext3_error in case of failures
From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

This fixes some instances where we were continuing after calling
ext3_error.  ext3_error calls panic only if errors=panic mount option is
set.  So we need to make sure we return correctly after ext3_error call
