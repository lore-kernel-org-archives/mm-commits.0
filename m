The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm/collapse: declare the collapse interface in collapse.h
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-collapse-declare-the-collapse-interface-in-collapseh.patch

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be issued

------------------------------------------------------
From: "Kiryl Shutsemau (Meta)" <kas@kernel.org>
Subject: mm/collapse: declare the collapse interface in collapse.h
Date: Wed, 16 Sep 2026 10:31:38 +0100

A collapse takes four calls:

  - collapse_control_init() - set up the control a caller carries;
  - collapse_scan_pmd() - scan one PTE table, under mmap_lock;
  - collapse_run_pmd() - collapse what the scan found, no mmap_lock;
  - collapse_control_release() - done with the control.

All four are static in khugepaged.c, as are collapse_possible_orders(),
which says what a VMA allows, and the revalidate a caller needs once a
collapse has given the mmap_lock up.  No other file can ask for a collapse
without them.

Declare them in collapse.h, with a comment stating the order they are
called in and who holds the lock over each step.  Each function says what
it needs and what it does where it is defined.

hugepage_vma_revalidate() becomes collapse_vma_revalidate(): it is part of
what a collapse offers now, not a helper of the daemon.

Preparation for implementing MADV_COLLAPSE in madvise.c.

No functional change.
