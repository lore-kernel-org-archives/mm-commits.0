The patch titled
     ext4: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext4-dont-inherit-inappropriate-inode-flags-from-parent.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext4: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

At present INDEX and EXTENTS are the only flags that new ext4 inodes do
NOT inherit from their parent.  In addition prevent the flags DIRTY,
ECOMPR, IMAGIC, TOPDIR, HUGE_FILE and EXT_MIGRATE from being inherited. 
List inheritable flags explicitly to prevent future flags from
accidentally being inherited.

This fixes the TOPDIR flag inheritance bug reported at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9866.
