Subject: compiler-gcc.h: add gcc-recommended GCC_VERSION macro

Throughout compiler*.h, many version checks are made.  These can be
simplified by using the macro that gcc's documentation recommends.
However, my primary reason for adding this is that I need bug-check
macros that are enabled at certain gcc versions and it's cleaner to use
this macro than the tradition method:

if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ => 2)

If you add patch level, it gets this ugly:

if __GNUC__ > 4 || (__GNUC__ == 4 && (__GNUC_MINOR__ > 2 || \
   __GNUC_MINOR__ == 2 __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ >= 1))

As opposed to:

if GCC_VERSION >= 40201

While having separate headers for gcc 3 & 4 eliminates some of this
verbosity, they can still be cleaned up by this.
