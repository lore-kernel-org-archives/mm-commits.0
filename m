Subject: mm/migrate: move node demotion code to near its user

Now, node_demotion and next_demotion_node() are placed between
__unmap_and_move() and unmap_and_move().  This hurts code readability.  So
move them near their users in the file.  There's no functionality change
in this patch.

- * node_demotion[] example:
- *
- * Consider a system with two sockets.  Each socket has
- * three classes of memory attached: fast, medium and slow.
- * Each memory class is placed in its own NUMA node.  The
- * CPUs are placed in the node with the "fast" memory.  The
- * 6 NUMA nodes (0-5) might be split among the sockets like
- * this:
- *
- *	Socket A: 0, 1, 2
- *	Socket B: 3, 4, 5
- *
- * When Node 0 fills up, its memory should be migrated to
- * Node 1.  When Node 1 fills up, it should be migrated to
- * Node 2.  The migration path start on the nodes with the
- * processors (since allocations default to this node) and
- * fast memory, progress through medium and end with the
- * slow memory:
- *
- *	0 -> 1 -> 2 -> stop
- *	3 -> 4 -> 5 -> stop
- *
- * This is represented in the node_demotion[] like this:
- *
- *	{  nr=1, nodes[0]=1 }, // Node 0 migrates to 1
- *	{  nr=1, nodes[0]=2 }, // Node 1 migrates to 2
- *	{  nr=0, nodes[0]=-1 }, // Node 2 does not migrate
- *	{  nr=1, nodes[0]=4 }, // Node 3 migrates to 4
- *	{  nr=1, nodes[0]=5 }, // Node 4 migrates to 5
- *	{  nr=0, nodes[0]=-1 }, // Node 5 does not migrate
- *
- * Moreover some systems may have multiple slow memory nodes.
- * Suppose a system has one socket with 3 memory nodes, node 0
- * is fast memory type, and node 1/2 both are slow memory
- * type, and the distance between fast memory node and slow
- * memory node is same. So the migration path should be:
- *
- *	0 -> 1/2 -> stop
- *
- * This is represented in the node_demotion[] like this:
- *	{ nr=2, {nodes[0]=1, nodes[1]=2} }, // Node 0 migrates to node 1 and node 2
- *	{ nr=0, nodes[0]=-1, }, // Node 1 dose not migrate
- *	{ nr=0, nodes[0]=-1, }, // Node 2 does not migrate

-/*
- * Writes to this array occur without locking.  Cycles are
- * not allowed: Node X demotes to Y which demotes to X...
