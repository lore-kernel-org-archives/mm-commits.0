The patch titled
     ext3: fix chain verification in ext3_get_blocks()
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-fix-chain-verification-in-ext3_get_blocks.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext3: fix chain verification in ext3_get_blocks()
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

Chain verification in ext3_get_blocks() has been hosed since it called
verify_chain(chain, NULL) which always returns success.  As a result
readers could in theory race with truncate.  On the other hand the race
probably cannot happen with the current locking scheme, since by the time
ext3_truncate() is called all the pages are already removed and hence
get_block() shouldn't be called on such pages...
