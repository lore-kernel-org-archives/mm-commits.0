Subject: JBD: Fix JBD warnings when compiling with CONFIG_JBD_DEBUG
From: Jose R. Santos <jrs@us.ibm.com>

Note from Mingming's JBD2 fix:

Noticed all warnings are occurs when the debug level is 0.  Then found the
"jbd2: Move jbd2-debug file to debugfs" patch
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=0f49d5d019afa4e94253bfc92f0daca3badb990b

changed the jbd2_journal_enable_debug from int type to u8, makes the
jbd_debug comparision is always true when the debugging level is 0.  Thus
the compile warning occurs.

Thought about changing the jbd2_journal_enable_debug data type back to int,
but can't, because the jbd2-debug is moved to debug fs, where calling
debugfs_create_u8() to create the debugfs entry needs the value to be u8
type.

Even if we changed the data type back to int, the code is still buggy,
kernel should not print jbd2 debug message if the jbd2_journal_enable_debug
is set to 0.  But this is not the case.

The fix is change the level of debugging to 1.  The same should fixed in
ext3/JBD, but currently ext3 jbd-debug via /proc fs is broken, so we
probably should fix it all together.
