IA64 support 2 ELF format (IA64 binary and IA32 binary),
thus if 2 elf related header included, cause many warning or error.

about 2 week ago, J. Bruce Fields proposed this problem fixed patch.
(http://marc.info/?l=linux-ia64&m=120329313305695&w=2)

but unfortunately, it can't applied -mm tree.
I rebase against 2.6.25-rc2-mm1.
