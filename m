Subject: memcg: allow a memcg with kmem charges to be destructed

Because the ultimate goal of the kmem tracking in memcg is to track slab
pages as well, we can't guarantee that we'll always be able to point a
page to a particular process, and migrate the charges along with it -
since in the common case, a page will contain data belonging to multiple
processes.

Because of that, when we destroy a memcg, we only make sure the
destruction will succeed by discounting the kmem charges from the user
charges when we try to empty the cgroup.
