 If you have a w1 bus that never changes (you don't add or remove devices),
-you can set w1_master_search to a positive value to disable searches.
+you can set the module parameter search_count to a small positive number
+for an initially small number of bus searches.  Alternatively it could be
+set to zero, then manually add the slave device serial numbers by
+w1_master_add device file.  The w1_master_add and w1_master_remove files
+generally only make sense when searching is disabled, as a search will
+redetect manually removed devices that are present and timeout manually
+added devices that aren't on the bus.
