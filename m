The patch titled
     scsi: fix sense key MEDIUM ERROR processing and retry
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     fix-sense-key-medium-error-processing-and-retry.patch

This patch was dropped because it had testing failures

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: scsi: fix sense key MEDIUM ERROR processing and retry
From: Luben Tuikov <ltuikov@yahoo.com>

- If the device reports an uncorrectable MEDIUM ERROR, such as SK MEDIUM
  ERROR, ASC UNRECOVERED READ ERR, AMNF DATA FIELD or RECORD NOT FOUND,
  then: In scsi_check_sense() return SUCCESS so as to not retry -- the
  error is uncorrectable -- this speeds up total processing time.

- In scsi_io_completion(), retry if and only if there was at least one
  byte completed, i.e.  good_bytes != 0.  If good_bytes == 0, don't try to
  retry.

Without this patch, SCSI Core gets hung reading sector 0 forever, for
example when reading the partition table of a (newly discovered) device.


Here is what happens: sector 0 is broken -- the device cannot read the media
at that location.  The device properly returns a certain type of uncorrectable
MEDIUM ERROR (ASC: UNRECOVERABLE READ ERR).

SCSI Core loops around its retries (which this patch fixes) and eventually
gives up and sends it for "completion".  This is what happens when
scsi_check_sense() returns NEEDS_RETRY to scsi_decide_disposition() to
scsi_softirq().  The first chunk of the patch fixes this.

We end up in scsi_io_completion(), where good_bytes = 0, and result =
0x08000002 (DRIVER SENSE and CHECK CONDITION).

This statement in scsi_io_completion() causes the infinite retry loop:

   if (scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, !!result) == NULL)
         return;

substitute to get: scsi_end_request(cmd, uptodate=1, uptodate bytes=0,
retry=1) Yeah, but it doesn't make sense to call scsi_end_request() with
uptodate=1 and uptodate bytes = 0.  This causes the infinite retry, since the
code tries to re-read the whole xfer size (0 bytes were uptodate and retry=1),
from the bad media.

That is, we want to set uptodate=1 iff there was at least 1 byte up to date. 
Else if nothing was read, uptodate bytes = 0, then we should pass uptodate =
0, uptodate_bytes = total xfer, to mean the whole xfer is not uptodate; and
retry iff there was no error.  (This is the very bottom of the function.)
