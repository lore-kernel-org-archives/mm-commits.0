Subject: writeback: check skipped pages on WB_SYNC_ALL
From: Wu Fengguang <fengguang.wu@intel.com>

In WB_SYNC_ALL mode, filesystems are not expected to skip dirty pages on
temporal lock contentions or non fatal errors, otherwise sync() will
return without actually syncing the skipped pages.  Add a check to catch
possible redirty_page_for_writepage() callers that violate this
expectation.

I'd recommend to keep this check in -mm tree for some time and fixup the
possible warnings before pushing it to upstream.
