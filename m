The patch titled
     exportfs: update documentation
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     exportfs-update-documentation.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: exportfs: update documentation
From: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

Update documentation to the current state of affairs.  Remove duplicated
method descruptions in exportfs.h and point to Documentation/filesystems/
Exporting instead.  Add a little file header comment in expfs.c describing
what's going on and mentioning Neils and my copyright [1].

@@ -101,67 +102,39 @@ For a filesystem to be exportable it mus
   A file system implementation declares that instances of the filesystem
 are exportable by setting the s_export_op field in the struct
 super_block.  This field must point to a "struct export_operations"
-struct which could potentially be full of NULLs, though normally at
-least get_parent will be set.
+struct which has the following members:
 
- The primary operations are decode_fh and encode_fh.  
-decode_fh takes a filehandle fragment and tries to find or create a
-dentry for the object referred to by the filehandle.
-encode_fh takes a dentry and creates a filehandle fragment which can
-later be used to find/create a dentry for the same object.
-
-decode_fh will probably make use of "find_exported_dentry".
-This function lives in the "exportfs" module which a filesystem does
-not need unless it is being exported.  So rather that calling
-find_exported_dentry directly, each filesystem should call it through
-the find_exported_dentry pointer in it's export_operations table.
-This field is set correctly by the exporting agent (e.g. nfsd) when a
-filesystem is exported, and before any export operations are called.
-
-find_exported_dentry needs three support functions from the
-filesystem:
-  get_name.  When given a parent dentry and a child dentry, this
-    should find a name in the directory identified by the parent
-    dentry, which leads to the object identified by the child dentry.
-    If no get_name function is supplied, a default implementation is
-    provided which uses vfs_readdir to find potential names, and
-    matches inode numbers to find the correct match.
-
-  get_parent.  When given a dentry for a directory, this should return 
-    a dentry for the parent.  Quite possibly the parent dentry will
-    have been allocated by d_alloc_anon.  
-    The default get_parent function just returns an error so any
-    filehandle lookup that requires finding a parent will fail.
-    ->lookup("..") is *not* used as a default as it can leave ".."
-    entries in the dcache which are too messy to work with.
-
-  get_dentry.  When given an opaque datum, this should find the
-    implied object and create a dentry for it (possibly with
-    d_alloc_anon). 
-    The opaque datum is whatever is passed down by the decode_fh
-    function, and is often simply a fragment of the filehandle
-    fragment.
-    decode_fh passes two datums through find_exported_dentry.  One that 
-    should be used to identify the target object, and one that can be
-    used to identify the object's parent, should that be necessary.
-    The default get_dentry function assumes that the datum contains an
-    inode number and a generation number, and it attempts to get the
-    inode using "iget" and check it's validity by matching the
-    generation number.  A filesystem should only depend on the default
-    if iget can safely be used this way.
-
-If decode_fh and/or encode_fh are left as NULL, then default
-implementations are used.  These defaults are suitable for ext2 and 
-extremely similar filesystems (like ext3).
-
-The default encode_fh creates a filehandle fragment from the inode
-number and generation number of the target together with the inode
-number and generation number of the parent (if the parent is
-required).
-
-The default decode_fh extract the target and parent datums from the
-filehandle assuming the format used by the default encode_fh and
-passed them to find_exported_dentry.

+    implementation creates a filehandle fragment that encodes a 32bit inode
+    and generation number for the inode encoded, and if necessary the
+    same information for the parent.
+
+  fh_to_dentry (mandatory)
+    Given a filehandle fragment, this should find the implied object and
+    create a dentry for it (possibly with d_alloc_anon).

- *
- *    export_operations contains two basic operation for dealing with file

- *    operations to be defined which standard helper routines use to get
- *    specific information from the filesystem.
- *
- *    nfsd encodes information use to determine which filesystem a filehandle
- *    applies to in the initial part of the file handle.  The remainder, termed
- *    a file handle fragment, is controlled completely by the filesystem.  The
- *    standard helper routines assume that this fragment will contain one or
- *    two sub-fragments, one which identifies the file, and one which may be
- *    used to identify the (a) directory containing the file.
- *
- *    In some situations, nfsd needs to get a dentry which is connected into a
- *    specific part of the file tree.  To allow for this, it passes the
- *    function acceptable() together with a @context which can be used to see
- *    if the dentry is acceptable.  As there can be multiple dentrys for a
- *    given file, the filesystem should check each one for acceptability before
- *    looking for the next.  As soon as an acceptable one is found, it should
