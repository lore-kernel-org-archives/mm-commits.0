Subject: kasan: stop tests being eliminated as dead code with FORTIFY_SOURCE

Patch series "Fix some incompatibilites between KASAN and FORTIFY_SOURCE", v3.

3 KASAN self-tests fail on a kernel with both KASAN and FORTIFY_SOURCE:
memchr, memcmp and strlen.  I have observed this on x86 and powerpc.

When FORTIFY_SOURCE is on, a number of functions are replaced with
fortified versions, which attempt to check the sizes of the operands. 
However, these functions often directly invoke __builtin_foo() once they
have performed the fortify check.

This breaks things in 2 ways:

 - the three function calls are technically dead code, and can be
   eliminated. When __builtin_ versions are used, the compiler can detect
   this.

 - Using __builtins may bypass KASAN checks if the compiler decides to
   inline it's own implementation as sequence of instructions, rather than
   emit a function call that goes out to a KASAN-instrumented
   implementation.

The patches address each reason in turn. Finally, test_memcmp used a
stack array without explicit initialisation, which can sometimes break
too, so fix that up.


This patch (of 3):

3 KASAN self-tests fail on a kernel with both KASAN and FORTIFY_SOURCE:
memchr, memcmp and strlen.

When FORTIFY_SOURCE is on, a number of functions are replaced with
fortified versions, which attempt to check the sizes of the operands. 
However, these functions often directly invoke __builtin_foo() once they
have performed the fortify check.  The compiler can detect that the
results of these functions are not used, and knows that they have no other
side effects, and so can eliminate them as dead code.

Why are only memchr, memcmp and strlen affected?
================================================

Of string and string-like functions, kasan_test tests:

 * strchr  ->  not affected, no fortified version
 * strrchr ->  likewise
 * strcmp  ->  likewise
 * strncmp ->  likewise

 * strnlen ->  not affected, the fortify source implementation calls the
               underlying strnlen implementation which is instrumented, not
               a builtin

 * strlen  ->  affected, the fortify souce implementation calls a __builtin
               version which the compiler can determine is dead.

 * memchr  ->  likewise
 * memcmp  ->  likewise

 * memset ->   not affected, the compiler knows that memset writes to its
	       first argument and therefore is not dead.

Why does this not affect the functions normally?
================================================

In string.h, these functions are not marked as __pure, so the compiler
cannot know that they do not have side effects.  If relevant functions are
marked as __pure in string.h, we see the following warnings and the
functions are elided:

lib/test_kasan.c: In function `kasan_memchr':
lib/test_kasan.c:606:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
  memchr(ptr, '1', size + 1);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lib/test_kasan.c: In function `kasan_memcmp':
lib/test_kasan.c:622:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
  memcmp(ptr, arr, size+1);
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lib/test_kasan.c: In function `kasan_strings':
lib/test_kasan.c:645:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
  strchr(ptr, '1');
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...

This annotation would make sense to add and could be added at any point, so
the behaviour of test_kasan.c should change.

The fix
=======

Make all the functions that are pure write their results to a global,
which makes them live. The strlen and memchr tests now pass.

The memcmp test still fails to trigger, which is addressed in the next
patch.
