The patch titled
     ext4: return -EIO not -ESTALE on directory traversal through deleted inode
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext4-return-eio-not-estale-on-directory-traversal-through-deleted-inode.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext4: return -EIO not -ESTALE on directory traversal through deleted inode
From: Bryan Donlan <bdonlan@gmail.com>

ext4_iget() returns -ESTALE if invoked on a deleted inode, in order to
report errors to NFS properly.  However, in ext[234]_lookup(), this
-ESTALE can be propagated to userspace if the filesystem is corrupted such
that a directory entry references a deleted inode.  This leads to a
misleading error message - "Stale NFS file handle" - and confusion on the
part of the admin.

The bug can be easily reproduced by creating a new filesystem, making a
link to an unused inode using debugfs, then mounting and attempting to ls
-l said link.

This patch thus changes ext4_lookup to return -EIO if it receives -ESTALE
from ext4_iget(), as ext4 does for other filesystem metadata corruption;
and also invokes the appropriate ext*_error functions when this case is
detected.
