Subject: memcg: new force_empty to free pages under group
From: KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

By memcg-move-all-accounts-to-parent-at-rmdir.patch, there is no leak of
memory usage and force_empty is removed.

This patch adds "force_empty" again, in reasonable manner.

memory.force_empty file works when

  #echo 0 (or some) > memory.force_empty
  and have following function.

  1. only works when there are no task in this cgroup.
  2. free all page under this cgroup as much as possible.
  3. page which cannot be freed will be moved up to parent.
  4. Then, memcg will be empty after above echo returns.

This is much better behavior than old "force_empty" which just forget
all accounts. This patch also check signal_pending() and above "echo"
can be stopped by "Ctrl-C".

 A cgroup can be removed by rmdir, but as discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2, a
 cgroup might have some charge associated with it, even though all
 tasks have migrated away from it.
-Such charges are moved to its parent as much as possible and freed if parent
-is full. Both of RSS and CACHES are moved to parent.
-If both of them are busy, rmdir() returns -EBUSY.
+Such charges are freed(at default) or moved to its parent. When moved,
+both of RSS and CACHES are moved to parent.
+If both of them are busy, rmdir() returns -EBUSY. See 5.1 Also.
 
-5. TODO
+5. Misc. interfaces.
+
+5.1 force_empty
+  memory.force_empty interface is provided to make cgroup's memory usage empty.
+  You can use this interface only when the cgroup has no tasks.
+  When writing anything to this
+
+  # echo 0 > memory.force_empty
+
+  Almost all pages tracked by this memcg will be unmapped and freed. Some of
+  pages cannot be freed because it's locked or in-use. Such pages are moved
+  to parent and this cgroup will be empty. But this may return -EBUSY in
+  some too busy case.
+
+  Typical use case of this interface is that calling this before rmdir().
+  Because rmdir() moves all pages to parent, some out-of-use page caches can be
+  moved to the parent. If you want to avoid that, force_empty will be useful.
+
+
+6. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
