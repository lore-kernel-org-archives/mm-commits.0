Subject: mm/huge_memory: move folio split common code to __folio_split()
Date: Fri, 7 Mar 2025 12:39:56 -0500

This is a preparation patch for folio_split().

In the upcoming patch folio_split() will share folio unmapping and
remapping code with split_huge_page_to_list_to_order(), so move the code
to a common function __folio_split() first.

Add a TODO for splitting large shmem folio in swap cache.

- * This function splits a large folio into smaller folios of order @new_order.
- * @page can point to any page of the large folio to split. The split operation
- * does not change the position of @page.
- *
- * Prerequisites:
- *
- * 1) The caller must hold a reference on the @page's owning folio, also known
- *    as the large folio.
- *
- * 2) The large folio must be locked.
- *
- * 3) The folio must not be pinned. Any unexpected folio references, including

- *    will receive an -EAGAIN.
- *
- * 4) @new_order > 1, usually. Splitting to order-1 anonymous folios is not
- *    supported for non-file-backed folios, because folio->_deferred_list, which
- *    is used by partially mapped folios, is stored in subpage 2, but an order-1
- *    folio only has subpages 0 and 1. File-backed order-1 folios are supported,
- *    since they do not use _deferred_list.
- *
- * After splitting, the caller's folio reference will be transferred to @page,
- * resulting in a raised refcount of @page after this call. The other pages may
- * be freed if they are not mapped.
- *
- * If @list is null, tail pages will be added to LRU list, otherwise, to @list.
- *
- * Pages in @new_order will inherit the mapping, flags, and so on from the
- * huge page.
- *
- * Returns 0 if the huge page was split successfully.
- *
- * Returns -EAGAIN if the folio has unexpected reference (e.g., GUP) or if
- * the folio was concurrently removed from the page cache.
- *
- * Returns -EBUSY when trying to split the huge zeropage, if the folio is
- * under writeback, if fs-specific folio metadata cannot currently be
- * released, or if some unexpected race happened (e.g., anon VMA disappeared,
- * truncation).
- *
- * Callers should ensure that the order respects the address space mapping
- * min-order if one is set for non-anonymous folios.
- *
- * Returns -EINVAL when trying to split to an order that is incompatible
