Subject: direct-io: fix direct write stale data exposure from concurrent buffered read

Currently direct writes inside i_size on a DIO_SKIP_HOLES filesystem are
not allowed to allocate blocks(get_more_blocks() sets 'create' to 0 before
calling get_block() callback), if it's a sparse file, direct writes fall
back to buffered writes to avoid stale data exposure from concurrent
buffered read.  But there're two cases that can result in stale data
exposure are not correctly detected.

1. The detection for "writing inside i_size" is not sufficient, writes
   can be treated as "extending writes" wrongly.  For example, direct
   write 1FSB to a 1FSB sparse file on ext2/3/4, starting from offset 0,
   in this case it's writing inside i_size, but 'create' is non-zero,
   because 'block_in_file' and '(i_size_read(inode) >> blkbits' are both
   zero.

2. Direct writes starting from or beyong i_size (not inside i_size)
   also could trigger block allocation and expose stale data.  For
   example, consider a sparse file with i_size of 2k, and a write to
   offset 2k or 3k into the file, with a filesystem block size of 4k. 
   (Thanks to Jeff Moyer for pointing this case out in his review.)

The first problem can be demostrated by running ltp-aiodio test ADSP045
many times.  When testing on extN filesystems, I see test failures
occasionally, buffered read could read non-zero (stale) data.

ADSP045: dio_sparse -a 4k -w 4k -s 2k -n 1

dio_sparse    0  TINFO  :  Dirtying free blocks
dio_sparse    0  TINFO  :  Starting I/O tests
non zero buffer at buf[0] => 0xffffffaa,ffffffaa,ffffffaa,ffffffaa
non-zero read at offset 0
dio_sparse    0  TINFO  :  Killing childrens(s)
dio_sparse    1  TFAIL  :  dio_sparse.c:191: 1 children(s) exited abnormally

The second problem can also be reproduced easily by a hacked dio_sparse
program, which accepts an option to specify the write offset.

What we should really do is to disable block allocation for writes that
could result in filling holes inside i_size.
