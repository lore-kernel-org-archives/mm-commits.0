Subject: pipe: check limits only when increasing pipe capacity

When changing a pipe's capacity with fcntl(F_SETPIPE_SZ), various limits
defined by /proc/sys/fs/pipe-* files are checked to see if unprivileged
users are exceeding limits on memory consumption.

While documenting and testing the operation of these limits I noticed
that, as currently implemented, these checks can lead to cases where a
user can increase a pipe's capacity and is then unable to decrease the
capacity.  The origin of the problem is two-fold:

(1) When increasing the pipe capacity, the checks against the limits
    in /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-{soft,hard} are made against
    existing consumption, and exclude the memory required for the
    increased pipe capacity. The new increase in pipe capacity
    can then push the total memory used by the user for pipes
    (possibly far) over a limit.

(2) The limit checks are performed even when the new pipe capacity
    is less than the existing pipe capacity. This can lead to
    problems if a user sets a large pipe capacity, and then the
    limits are lowered, with the result that the user will no
    longer be able to decrease the pipe capacity.

The simple solution given by this patch is to perform the checks only when
the pipe capacity is being increased.  The patch does not address the
broken check in (1), which allows a user to (one-time) set a pipe capacity
that pushes the user's consumption over the user pipe limits.  A change to
fix that check is proposed in a subsequent patch.  I've separated the two
fixes because the second fix is a little more complex, and could possibly
(though unlikely) break existing user-space.  The current patch implements
the simple fix that carries little risk and seems obviously correct:
allowing an unprivileged user always to decrease a pipe's capacity.

The program below can be used to demonstrate the problem, and the effect
of the fix.  The program takes one or more command-line arguments.  The
first argument specifies the number of pipes that the program should
create.  The remaining arguments are, alternately, pipe capacities that
should be set using fcntl(F_SETPIPE_SZ), and sleep intervals (in seconds)
between the fcntl() operations.  (The sleep intervals allow the
possibility to change the limits between fcntl() operations.)

Running this program on an unpatched kernel, we first set some limits:

    # getconf PAGESIZE
    4096
    # echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft
    # echo 1000000000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
    # echo 10000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard    # 40.96 MB

Now perform two fcntl(F_SETPIPE_SZ) operations on a single pipe, first
setting a pipe capacity (10MB), sleeping for a few seconds, during which
time the hard limit is lowered, and then set pipe capacity to a smaller
amount (5MB):

    # sudo -u mtk ./test_F_SETPIPE_SZ 1 10000000 15 5000000 &
    [1] 748
    #     Loop 1: set pipe capacity to 10000000 bytes
            F_SETPIPE_SZ returned 16777216
            Sleeping 15 seconds

    # echo 1000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard      # 4.096 MB

    #     Loop 2: set pipe capacity to 5000000 bytes
            Loop 2, pipe 0: F_SETPIPE_SZ failed: fcntl: Operation not permitted

In this case, the user should be able to lower the limit.

With a kernel that has the patch below, the second fcntl()
succeeds:

    # echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft
    # echo 1000000000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size
    # echo 10000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard
    # sudo -u mtk ./test_F_SETPIPE_SZ 1 10000000 15 5000000 &
    [1] 3215
    #     Loop 1: set pipe capacity to 10000000 bytes
            F_SETPIPE_SZ returned 16777216
            Sleeping 15 seconds

    # echo 1000 > /proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard

    #     Loop 2: set pipe capacity to 5000000 bytes
            F_SETPIPE_SZ returned 8388608
