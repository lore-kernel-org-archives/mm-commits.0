The patch titled
     Subject: lib/stackdepot: move documentation comments to stackdepot.h
has been added to the -mm mm-nonmm-unstable branch.  Its filename is
     lib-stackdepot-move-documentation-comments-to-stackdepoth.patch

This patch will shortly appear at
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/25-new.git/tree/patches/lib-stackdepot-move-documentation-comments-to-stackdepoth.patch

This patch will later appear in the mm-nonmm-unstable branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

The -mm tree is included into linux-next via the mm-everything
branch at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm
and is updated there every 2-3 working days

Subject: lib/stackdepot: move documentation comments to stackdepot.h
Date: Mon, 30 Jan 2023 21:49:42 +0100

Move all interface- and usage-related documentation comments to
include/linux/stackdepot.h.

It makes sense to have them in the header where they are available to
the interface users.
