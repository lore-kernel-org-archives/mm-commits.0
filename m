Subject: mm: propagate VM_SOFTDIRTY on merge
Date: Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:33:38 +0000

Patch series "make VM_SOFTDIRTY a sticky VMA flag", v2.

Currently we set VM_SOFTDIRTY when a new mapping is set up (whether by
establishing a new VMA, or via merge) as implemented in __mmap_complete()
and do_brk_flags().

However, when performing a merge of existing mappings such as when
performing mprotect(), we may lose the VM_SOFTDIRTY flag.

Now we have the concept of making VMA flags 'sticky', that is that they
both don't prevent merge and, importantly, are propagated to merged VMAs,
this seems a sensible alternative to the existing special-casing of
VM_SOFTDIRTY.

We additionally add a self-test that demonstrates that this logic behaves
as expected.


This patch (of 2):

Currently we set VM_SOFTDIRTY when a new mapping is set up (whether by
establishing a new VMA, or via merge) as implemented in __mmap_complete()
and do_brk_flags().

However, when performing a merge of existing mappings such as when
performing mprotect(), we may lose the VM_SOFTDIRTY flag.

This is because currently we simply ignore VM_SOFTDIRTY for the purposes
of merge, so one VMA may possess the flag and another not, and whichever
happens to be the target VMA will be the one upon which the merge is
performed which may or may not have VM_SOFTDIRTY set.

Now we have the concept of 'sticky' VMA flags, let's make VM_SOFTDIRTY one
which solves this issue.

Additionally update VMA userland tests to propagate changes.
