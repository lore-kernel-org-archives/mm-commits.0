The patch titled
     ext3: fix synchronization of quota files in journal=data mode
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-fix-synchronization-of-quota-files-in-journal=data-mode.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext3: fix synchronization of quota files in journal=data mode
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

In journal=data mode, it is not enough to do write_inode_now as done in
vfs_quota_on() to write all data to their final location (which is needed for
quota_read to work correctly).  Calling journal_flush() does its job.
