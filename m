The patch titled
     ext3: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-dont-inherit-inappropriate-inode-flags-from-parent.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext3: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

At present INDEX is the only flag that new ext3 inodes do NOT inherit from
their parent.  In addition prevent the flags DIRTY, ECOMPR, IMAGIC and
TOPDIR from being inherited.  List inheritable flags explicitly to prevent
future flags from accidentally being inherited.

This fixes the TOPDIR flag inheritance bug reported at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9866.
