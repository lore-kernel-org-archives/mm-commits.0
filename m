Subject: ext3 balloc: reset windowsz when full
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

ext3_new_blocks should reset the reservation window size to 0 when squeezing
the last blocks out of an almost full filesystem, so the retry doesn't skip
any groups with less than half that free, reporting ENOSPC too soon.
