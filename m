Subject: sys_swapon: call swap_cgroup_swapon() earlier
From: Cesar Eduardo Barros <cesarb@cesarb.net>

The call to swap_cgroup_swapon is in the middle of loading the swap map
and extents. As it only does memory allocation and does not depend on
the swapfile layout (map/extents), it can be called earlier (or later).

Move it to just after the allocation of swap_map, since it is
conceptually similar (allocates a map).
