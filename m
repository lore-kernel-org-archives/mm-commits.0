Subject: ext4: fdatasync should skip metadata writeout when overwriting
From: Hisashi Hifumi <hifumi.hisashi@oss.ntt.co.jp>

Currently fdatasync is identical to fsync in ext3.

I think fdatasync should skip journal flush in data=ordered and
data=writeback mode when it overwrites to already-instantiated blocks on
HDD.  When I_DIRTY_DATASYNC flag is not set, fdatasync should skip journal
writeout because this indicates only atime or/and mtime updates.

Following patch is the same approach of ext2's fsync code(ext2_sync_file).

I did a performance test using the sysbench.

#sysbench --num-threads=128 --max-requests=50000 --test=fileio --file-total-size=128G
--file-test-mode=rndwr --file-fsync-mode=fdatasync run

The result on ext3 was:
