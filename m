Subject: mm: don't use compound_head() in virt_to_head_page()

compound_head() is implemented with assumption that there would be
race condition when checking tail flag. This assumption is only true
when we try to access arbitrary positioned struct page.

The situation that virt_to_head_page() is called is different case.
We call virt_to_head_page() only in the range of allocated pages,
so there is no race condition on tail flag. In this case, we don't
need to handle race condition and we can reduce overhead slightly.
This patch implements compound_head_fast() which is similar with
compound_head() except tail flag race handling. And then,
virt_to_head_page() uses this optimized function to improve performance.

I saw 1.8% win in a fast-path loop over kmem_cache_alloc/free,
(14.063 ns -> 13.810 ns) if target object is on tail page.
