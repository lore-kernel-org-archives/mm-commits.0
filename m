The quilt patch titled
     Subject: mm: set the VM_MAYBE_GUARD flag on guard region install
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     mm-set-the-vm_maybe_guard-flag-on-guard-region-install.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into the mm-stable branch
of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

From: Lorenzo Stoakes <lorenzo.stoakes@oracle.com>
Subject: mm: set the VM_MAYBE_GUARD flag on guard region install
Date: Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:17:48 +0000

Now we have established the VM_MAYBE_GUARD flag and added the capacity to
set it atomically, do so upon MADV_GUARD_INSTALL.

The places where this flag is used currently and matter are:

* VMA merge - performed under mmap/VMA write lock, therefore excluding
  racing writes.

* /proc/$pid/smaps - can race the write, however this isn't meaningful
  as the flag write is performed at the point of the guard region being
  established, and thus an smaps reader can't reasonably expect to avoid
  races.  Due to atomicity, a reader will observe either the flag being
  set or not.  Therefore consistency will be maintained.

In all other cases the flag being set is irrelevant and atomicity
guarantees other flags will be read correctly.

Note that non-atomic updates of unrelated flags do not cause an issue with
this flag being set atomically, as writes of other flags are performed
under mmap/VMA write lock, and these atomic writes are performed under
mmap/VMA read lock, which excludes the write, avoiding RMW races.

Note that we do not encounter issues with KCSAN by adjusting this flag
atomically, as we are only updating a single bit in the flag bitmap and
therefore we do not need to annotate these changes.

We intentionally set this flag in advance of actually updating the page
tables, to ensure that any racing atomic read of this flag will only
return false prior to page tables being updated, to allow for
serialisation via page table locks.

Note that we set vma->anon_vma for anonymous mappings.  This is because
the expectation for anonymous mappings is that an anon_vma is established
should they possess any page table mappings.  This is also consistent with
what we were doing prior to this patch (unconditionally setting anon_vma
on guard region installation).

We also need to update retract_page_tables() to ensure that madvise(...,
MADV_COLLAPSE) doesn't incorrectly collapse file-backed ranges contain
guard regions.

This was previously guarded by anon_vma being set to catch MAP_PRIVATE
cases, but the introduction of VM_MAYBE_GUARD necessitates that we check
this flag instead.

We utilise vma_flag_test_atomic() to do so - we first perform an
optimistic check, then after the PTE page table lock is held, we can check
again safely, as upon guard marker install the flag is set atomically
prior to the page table lock being taken to actually apply it.

So if the initial check fails either:

* Page table retraction acquires page table lock prior to VM_MAYBE_GUARD
  being set - guard marker installation will be blocked until page table
  retraction is complete.

OR:

* Guard marker installation acquires page table lock after setting
  VM_MAYBE_GUARD, which raced and didn't pick this up in the initial
  optimistic check, blocking page table retraction until the guard regions
  are installed - the second VM_MAYBE_GUARD check will prevent page table
  retraction.

Either way we're safe.

We refactor the retraction checks into a single
file_backed_vma_is_retractable(), there doesn't seem to be any reason that
the checks were separated as before.

Note that VM_MAYBE_GUARD being set atomically remains correct as
vma_needs_copy() is invoked with the mmap and VMA write locks held,
excluding any race with madvise_guard_install().
