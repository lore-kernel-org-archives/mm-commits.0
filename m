Subject: compat_ioctl: hook up compat handler for FIEMAP ioctl
From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

The FIEMAP_IOC_FIEMAP mapping ioctl was missing a 32-bit compat handler,
which means that 32-bit suerspace on 64-bit kernels cannot use this ioctl
command.

The structure is nicely aligned, padded, and sized, so it is just this
simple.

Tested w/ 32-bit ioctl tester (from Josef) on a 64-bit kernel on ext4.
