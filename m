The patch titled
     jbd2: abort instead of waiting for nonexistent transactions
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     jbd2-abort-instead-of-waiting-for-nonexistent-transactions.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: jbd2: abort instead of waiting for nonexistent transactions
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

The __jbd2_log_wait_for_space function sits in a loop checkpointing
transactions until there is sufficient space free in the journal. 
However, if there are no transactions to be processed (e.g.  because the
free space calculation is wrong due to a corrupted filesystem) it will
never progress.

Check for space being required when no transactions are outstanding and
abort the journal instead of endlessly looping.

This patch fixes the bug reported by Sami Liedes at:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10976
