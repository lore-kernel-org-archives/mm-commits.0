Subject: thp: setup huge zero page on non-write page fault

All code paths seems covered. Now we can map huge zero page on read page
fault.

We setup it in do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page() if area around fault address
is suitable for THP and we've got read page fault.

If we fail to setup huge zero page (ENOMEM) we fallback to
handle_pte_fault() as we normally do in THP.
