Subject: ext3: don't read inode block if the buffer has a write error
From: Hidehiro Kawai <hidehiro.kawai.ez@hitachi.com>

A transient I/O error can corrupt inode data.  Here is the scenario:

(1) update inode_A at the block_B
(2) pdflush writes out new inode_A to the filesystem, but it results
    in write I/O error, at this point, BH_Uptodate flag of the buffer
    for block_B is cleared and BH_Write_EIO is set
(3) create new inode_C which located at block_B, and
    __ext3_get_inode_loc() tries to read on-disk block_B because the
    buffer is not uptodate
(4) if it can read on-disk block_B successfully, inode_A is
    overwritten by old data

This patch makes __ext3_get_inode_loc() not read the inode block if the
buffer has BH_Write_EIO flag.  In this case, the buffer should have the
latest information, so setting the uptodate flag to the buffer (this
avoids WARN_ON_ONCE() in mark_buffer_dirty().)

According to this change, we would need to test BH_Write_EIO flag for the
error checking.  Currently nobody checks write I/O errors on metadata
buffers, but it will be done in other patches I'm working on.
