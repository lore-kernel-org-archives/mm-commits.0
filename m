Subject: mm: kswapd: use the order that kswapd was reclaiming at for sleeping_prematurely()
From: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

Before kswapd goes to sleep, it uses sleeping_prematurely() to check if
there was a race pushing a zone below its watermark.  If the race
happened, it stays awake.  However, balance_pgdat() can decide to reclaim
at order-0 if it decides that high-order reclaim is not working as
expected.  This information is not passed back to sleeping_prematurely(). 
The impact is that kswapd remains awake reclaiming pages long after it
should have gone to sleep.  This patch passes the adjusted order to
sleeping_prematurely and uses the same logic as balance_pgdat to decide if
it's ok to go to sleep.
