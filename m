Subject: jbd: abort when failed to log metadata buffers
From: Hidehiro Kawai <hidehiro.kawai.ez@hitachi.com>

If we failed to write metadata buffers to the journal space and succeeded
to write the commit record, stale data can be written back to the
filesystem as metadata in the recovery phase.

To avoid this, when we failed to write out metadata buffers, abort the
journal before writing the commit record.
