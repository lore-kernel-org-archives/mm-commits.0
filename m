The patch titled
     return ENOENT from ext3_link when racing with unlink
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     return-enoent-from-ext3_link-when-racing-with-unlink.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

Subject: return ENOENT from ext3_link when racing with unlink
From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>

Return -ENOENT from ext[34]_link if we've raced with unlink and i_nlink is
0.  Doing otherwise has the potential to corrupt the orphan inode list,
because we'd wind up with an inode with a non-zero link count on the list,
and it will never get properly cleaned up & removed from the orphan list
before it is freed.
