The patch titled
     ext2: fix data corruption for racing writes
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext2-fix-data-corruption-for-racing-writes.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext2: fix data corruption for racing writes
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

If two writers allocating blocks to file race with each other (e.g. 
because writepages races with ordinary write or two writepages race with
each other), ext2_getblock() can be called on the same inode in parallel. 
Before we are going to allocate new blocks, we have to recheck the block
chain we have obtained so far without holding truncate_mutex.  Otherwise
we could overwrite the indirect block pointer set by the other writer
leading to data loss.

The below test program by Ying is able to reproduce the data loss with ext2
on in BRD in a few minutes if the machine is under memory pressure:

long kMemSize  = 50 << 20;
int kPageSize = 4096;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int status;
	int count = 0;
	int i;
	char *fname = "/mnt/test.mmap";
	char *mem;
	unlink(fname);
	int fd = open(fname, O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_RDWR, 0600);
	status = ftruncate(fd, kMemSize);
	mem = mmap(0, kMemSize, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
	// Fill the memory with 1s.
	memset(mem, 1, kMemSize);
	sleep(2);
	for (i = 0; i < kMemSize; i++) {
		int byte_good = mem[i] != 0;
		if (!byte_good && ((i % kPageSize) == 0)) {
			//printf("%d ", i / kPageSize);
			count++;
		}
	}
	munmap(mem, kMemSize);
	close(fd);
	unlink(fname);

	if (count > 0) {
		printf("Running %d bad page\n", count);
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
