Subject: jbd: fix race in buffer processing in commit code
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

In commit code, we scan buffers attached to a transaction.  During this
scan, we sometimes have to drop j_list_lock and then we recheck whether
the journal buffer head didn't get freed by journal_try_to_free_buffers().
 But checking for buffer_jbd(bh) isn't enough because a new journal head
could get attached to our buffer head.  So add a check whether the journal
head remained the same and whether it's still at the same transaction and
list.

This is a nasty bug and can cause problems like memory corruption (use after
free) or trigger various assertions in JBD code (observed).
