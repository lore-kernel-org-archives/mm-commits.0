The patch titled
     Subject: asm-generic/tlb: avoid potential double flush
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     asm-generic-tlb-avoid-potential-double-flush.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>
Subject: asm-generic/tlb: avoid potential double flush

Aneesh reported that:

	tlb_flush_mmu()
	  tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly()
	    tlb_flush()			<-- #1
	  tlb_flush_mmu_free()
	    tlb_table_flush()
	      tlb_table_invalidate()
		tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly()
		  tlb_flush()		<-- #2

does two TLBIs when tlb->fullmm, because __tlb_reset_range() will not
clear tlb->end in that case.

Observe that any caller to __tlb_adjust_range() also sets at least one of
the tlb->freed_tables || tlb->cleared_p* bits, and those are
unconditionally cleared by __tlb_reset_range().

Change the condition for actually issuing TLBI to having one of those bits
set, as opposed to having tlb->end != 0.
