Subject: ext3: revert "ext3: wait on all pending commits in ext3_sync_fs"
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

This reverts commit c87591b719737b4e91eb1a9fa8fd55a4ff1886d6.

Since journal_start_commit() is now fixed to return 1 when we started a
transaction commit, there's some transaction waiting to be committed or
there's a transaction already committing, we don't need to call
ext3_force_commit() in ext3_sync_fs().  Furthermore ext3_force_commit()
can unnecessarily create sync transaction which is expensive so it's
worthwhile to remove it when we can.
