The patch titled
     ext3: don't try to resize if there are no reserved gdt blocks left
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-dont-try-to-resize-if-there-are-no-reserved-gdt-blocks-left.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext3: don't try to resize if there are no reserved gdt blocks left
From: Josef Bacik <jbacik@redhat.com>

When trying to resize a ext3 fs and you run out of reserved gdt blocks,
you get an error that doesn't actually tell you what went wrong, it just
says that the gdb it picked is not correct, which is the case since you
don't have any reserved gdt blocks left.  This patch adds a check to make
sure you have reserved gdt blocks to use, and if not prints out a more
relevant error.
