Subject: uml: deal with host time going backwards
From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>

Protection against the host's time going backwards (eg, ntp activity on
the host) by keeping track of the time at the last tick and if it's
greater than the current time, keep time stopped until the host catches
up.
