The patch titled
     ext2: Do not update mtime of a moved directory
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext2-do-not-update-mtime-of-a-moved-directory.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsyst=
em tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mm=
otm/

Subject: ext2: Do not update mtime of a moved directory
=46rom: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

One of our users is complaining that his backup tool is upset on ext2
(while it's happy on ext3, xfs, ...) because of the mtime change.

The problem is:

mkdir foo
mkdir bar
mkdir foo/a

Now under ext2:
mv foo/a foo/b

changes mtime of 'foo/a' (foo/b after the move).  That does not really
make sence and it does not happen under any other filesystem I've seen.

More complicated is:
mv foo/a bar/a

This changes mtime of foo/a (bar/a after the move) and it makes some se=
nce
since we had to update parent directory pointer of foo/a. But again, no
other filesystem does this. So after some thoughts I'd vote for consist=
ency
and change ext2 to behave the same as other filesystems.



Do not update mtime of a moved directory.  Specs don't say anything
about it (neither that it should, nor that it should not be updated)
and other common filesystems (ext3, ext4, xfs, reiserfs, fat, ...)
don't do it.  So let's become more consistent.

Spotted by ronny.pretzsch@dfs.de, initial fix by J=F6rn Engel.
