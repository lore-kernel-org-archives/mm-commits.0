The patch titled
     ext4 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext4-balloc-fix-_with_rsv-freeze.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: ext4 balloc: fix _with_rsv freeze
From: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

Port fix to the off-by-one in find_next_usable_block's memscan from ext2 to
ext4; but it didn't cause a serious problem for ext4 because the additional
ext4_test_allocatable check rescued it from the error.
