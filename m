Subject: tracehook: asm/syscall.h
From: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>

This adds asm-generic/syscall.h, which documents what a real
asm-ARCH/syscall.h file should define.  This is not used yet, but will
provide all the machine-dependent details of examining a user system call
about to begin, in progress, or just ended.

Each arch should add an asm-ARCH/syscall.h that defines all the entry
points documented in asm-generic/syscall.h, as short inlines if possible. 
This lets us write new tracing code that understands user system call
registers, without any new arch-specific work.
