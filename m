Subject: jbd: replace potentially false assertion with if block
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

If an error occurs during jbd cache initialisation it is possible for the
journal_head_cache to be NULL when journal_destroy_journal_head_cache is
called.  Replace the J_ASSERT with an if block to handle the situation
correctly.

Note that even with this fix things will break badly if jbd is statically
compiled in and cache initialisation fails.
