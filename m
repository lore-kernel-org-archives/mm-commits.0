Subject: mm, hwpoison: set PG_hwpoison for busy hugetlb pages
Date: Mon, 4 Jul 2022 10:33:09 +0900

If memory_failure() fails to grab page refcount on a hugetlb page because
it's busy, it returns without setting PG_hwpoison on it.  This not only
loses a chance of error containment, but breaks the rule that
action_result() should be called only when memory_failure() do any of
handling work (even if that's just setting PG_hwpoison).  This
inconsistency could harm code maintainability.

So set PG_hwpoison and call hugetlb_set_page_hwpoison() for such a case.
