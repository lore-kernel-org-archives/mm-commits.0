The patch titled
     ext2: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was

This patch was dropped because an updated version will be merged

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext2: don't inherit inappropriate inode flags from parent
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

Fix the TOPDIR flag inheritance bug reported at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9866.

  Some file attributes have sticky behaviour in ext2/3 whereas I believe
  it should not.  Namely, a directory marked with chattr +T serves "to be
  the top of directory hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block
  allocator", as the manpage says.

  It seems wrong that subdirectories stickily inherit the +T flag: they
  are obviously not top-level!  Even files get the T attribute this way,
  even though the chattr manpages only documents it for directories.

Also prevent inheritance of other flags that Andreas Dilger identified as
inappropriate to inherit

At present BTREE is the only flag that new ext2 inodes do NOT inherit from
their parent.  In addition prevent the flags DIRTY, ECOMPR, INDEX, IMAGIC
and TOPDIR from being inherited.
