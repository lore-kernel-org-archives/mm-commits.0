The patch titled
     ext2: retry block allocation if new blocks are allocated from system zone
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext2-retry-block-allocation-if-new-blocks-are-allocated-from-system-zone.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: ext2: retry block allocation if new blocks are allocated from system zone
From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

If the block allocator gets blocks out of system zone ext2 calls ext2_error. 
But if the file system is mounted with errors=continue retry block allocation.
 We need to mark the system zone blocks as in use to make sure retry don't
pick them again

System zone is the block range mapping block bitmap, inode bitmap and inode
table.
