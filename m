The patch titled
     Subject: mm: Kconfig: move swap and slab config options to the MM section
has been added to the -mm mm-unstable branch.  Its filename is
     mm-kconfig-move-swap-and-slab-config-options-to-the-mm-section.patch

This patch will shortly appear at
     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/25-new.git/tree/patches/mm-kconfig-move-swap-and-slab-config-options-to-the-mm-section.patch

This patch will later appear in the mm-unstable branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/process/submit-checklist.rst when testing your code ***

The -mm tree is included into linux-next via the mm-everything
branch at git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/akpm/mm
and is updated there every 2-3 working days

Subject: mm: Kconfig: move swap and slab config options to the MM section

These are currently under General Setup. MM seems like a better fit.
