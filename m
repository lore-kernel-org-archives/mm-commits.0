Subject: mm/huge_memory: rename mmun_start to haddr in remove_migration_pmd
Date: Mon, 4 Jul 2022 21:21:51 +0800

mmun_start indicates mmu_notifier start address but there's no mmu_notifier
stuff in remove_migration_pmd. This will make it hard to get the meaning of
mmun_start. Rename it to haddr to avoid confusing readers and also imporve
readability.
