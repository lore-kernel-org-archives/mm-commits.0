Subject: Align faulting address to a hugepage boundary before unmapping
From: Mel Gorman <mel@csn.ul.ie>

When taking a fault for COW on a private mapping it is possible that the
parent will have to steal the original page from its children due to an
insufficient hugepage pool.  In this case, unmap_ref_private() is called
for the faulting address to unmap via unmap_hugepage_range(). This patch
ensures that the address used for unmapping is hugepage-aligned.
