The patch titled
     jbd2: Fix assertion failure in fs/jbd2/checkpoint.c
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     jbd2-fix-assertion-failure-in-fs-jbd2-checkpointc.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

------------------------------------------------------
Subject: jbd2: Fix assertion failure in fs/jbd2/checkpoint.c
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

Before we start committing a transaction, we call
__journal_clean_checkpoint_list() to cleanup transaction's written-back
buffers.

If this call happens to remove all of them (and there were already some
buffers), __journal_remove_checkpoint() will decide to free the transaction
because it isn't (yet) a committing transaction and soon we fail some
assertion - the transaction really isn't ready to be freed :).

We change the check in __journal_remove_checkpoint() to free only a
transaction in T_FINISHED state.  The locking there is subtle though (as
everywhere in JBD ;().  We use j_list_lock to protect the check and a
subsequent call to __journal_drop_transaction() and do the same in the end
of journal_commit_transaction() which is the only place where a transaction
can get to T_FINISHED state.

Probably I'm too paranoid here and such locking is not really necessary -
checkpoint lists are processed only from log_do_checkpoint() where a
transaction must be already committed to be processed or from
__journal_clean_checkpoint_list() where kjournald itself calls it and thus
transaction cannot change state either.  Better be safe if something
changes in future...
