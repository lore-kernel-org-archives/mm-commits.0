The patch titled
     jbd: positively dispose the unmapped data buffers in journal_commit_transaction()
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     jbd-positively-dispose-the-unmapped-data-buffers-in-journal_commit_transaction.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

The current -mm tree may be found at http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/

Subject: jbd: positively dispose the unmapped data buffers in journal_commit_transaction()
From: Toshiyuki Okajima <toshi.okajima@jp.fujitsu.com>

After ext3-ordered files are truncated, there is a possibility that the
pages which cannot be estimated still remain.  Remaining pages can be
released when the system has really few memory.  So, it is not memory
leakage.  But the resource management software etc.  may not work
correctly.

It is possible that journal_unmap_buffer() cannot release the buffers, and
the pages to which they belong because they are attached to a commiting
transaction and journal_unmap_buffer() cannot release them.  To release
such the buffers and the pages later, journal_unmap_buffer() leaves it to
journal_commit_transaction().  (journal_unmap_buffer() puts the mark
'BH_Freed' to the buffers so that journal_commit_transaction() can
identify whether they can be released or not.)

In the journalled mode and the writeback mode, jbd does with only metadata
buffers.  But in the ordered mode, jbd does with metadata buffers and also
data buffers.

Actually, journal_commit_transaction() releases only the metadata buffers
of which release is demanded by journal_unmap_buffer(), and also releases
the pages to which they belong if possible.

As a result, the data buffers of which release is demanded by
journal_unmap_buffer() remain after a transaction commits.  And also the
pages to which they belong remain.

Such the remained pages don't have mapping any longer.  Due to this fact,
there is a possibility that the pages which cannot be estimated remain.


The metadata buffers marked 'BH_Freed' and the pages to which
they belong can be released at 'JBD: commit phase 7'.

Therefore, by applying the same code into 'JBD: commit phase 2' (where the
data buffers are done with), journal_commit_transaction() can also release
the data buffers marked 'BH_Freed' and the pages to which they belong.

As a result, all the buffers marked 'BH_Freed' can be released, and also
all the pages to which these buffers belong can be released at
journal_commit_transaction().  So, the page which cannot be estimated is
lost.

****************************************************************
* Apply the code of "^^^^^^" lines into 'JBD: commit phase 2' *
****************************************************************

At journal_commit_transaction() code, there is one extra message in the
series of jbd debug messages.  ("JBD: commit phase 2") This patch fixes
it, too.
