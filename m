Subject: jbd: strictly check for write errors on data buffers
From: Hidehiro Kawai <hidehiro.kawai.ez@hitachi.com>

In ordered mode, we should abort journaling when an I/O error has occurred
on a file data buffer in the committing transaction.  But there can be
data buffers which are not checked for error:

  (a) the buffer which has already been written out by pdflush
  (b) the buffer which has been unlocked before scanned in the
      t_locked_list loop

This patch adds missing error checks and aborts journaling
appropriately.
