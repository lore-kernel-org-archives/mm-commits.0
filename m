Subject: ext3: fix support for empty directory blocks in 64k blocksize filesystems
From: Wei Yongjun <yjwei@cn.fujitsu.com>

The rec_len field in the directory entry is 16 bits, so if the filesystem
is completely empty, rec_len of 0 is used to designate 65536 in e2fsprogs,
for the case where the directory entry takes the entire 64k block.

But if an empty directory is read, an error message will be output by
current kernels.  You can use the following commands to reproduce it.

  - mkfs.ext3 -b $(( 64 * 1024 )) /dev/sdc1
  - mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
  - cd /mnt/lost+found
  - ll
  - tail /var/log/messages
  EXT3-fs error (device sdc1): ext3_readdir: bad entry in \
  directory #11: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, \
  inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0

Treat a rec_len of 0 as 65536, as e2fsprogs does.
