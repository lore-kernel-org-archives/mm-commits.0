Subject: ext4: return after ext4_error in case of failures
From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

This fix some instances where we were continuing after calling ext4_error. 
ext4_error call panic only if errors=panic mount option is set.  So we need to
make sure we return correctly after ext4_error call
