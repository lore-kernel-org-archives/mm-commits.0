Subject: ext3: fix chain verification in ext3_get_blocks()
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

Chain verification in ext3_get_blocks() has been hosed since it called
verify_chain(chain, NULL) which always returns success.  As a result
readers could in theory race with truncate.  On the other hand the race
probably cannot happen with the current locking scheme, since by the time
ext3_truncate() is called all the pages are already removed and hence
get_block() shouldn't be called on such pages...
