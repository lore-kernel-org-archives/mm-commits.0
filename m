Subject: ext3: fix deadlock in ext3_remount() and orphan list handling
From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

ext3_orphan_add() and ext3_orphan_del() functions lock sb->s_lock with a
transaction started with ext3_mark_recovery_complete() waits for a transaction
holding sb->s_lock, thus leading to a possible deadlock.  At the moment we
call ext3_mark_recovery_complete() from ext3_remount() we have done all the
work needed for remounting and thus we are safe to drop sb->s_lock before we
wait for transactions to commit.  Note that at this moment we are still
guarded by s_umount lock against other remounts/umounts.
