Subject: mm, vmalloc: protect va->vm by vmap_area_lock

Inserting and removing an entry to vmlist is linear time complexity, so it
is inefficient.  Following patches will try to remove vmlist entirely. 
This patch is preparing step for it.

For removing vmlist, iterating vmlist codes should be changed to iterating
a vmap_area_list.  Before implementing that, we should make sure that when
we iterate a vmap_area_list, accessing to va->vm doesn't cause a race
condition.  This patch ensure that when iterating a vmap_area_list, there
is no race condition for accessing to vm_struct.
