The patch titled
     ext3: fix the max file size for ext3 file system
has been removed from the -mm tree.  Its filename was
     ext3-fix-the-max-file-size-for-ext3-file-system.patch

This patch was dropped because it was merged into mainline or a subsystem tree

Subject: ext3: fix the max file size for ext3 file system
From: "Aneesh Kumar K.V" <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

The max file size for ext3 file system is now calculated with hardcoded 4K
block size.  The patch fixes it to be calculated with the right block size.
