Subject: jbd: correctly unescape journal data blocks
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

Fix a long-standing typo (predating git) that will cause data corruption if a
journal data block needs unescaping.  At the moment the wrong buffer head's
data is being unescaped.

To test this case mount a filesystem with data=journal, start creating and
deleting a bunch of files containing only JFS_MAGIC_NUMBER (0xc03b3998), then
pull the plug on the device.  Without this patch the files will contain zeros
instead of the correct data after recovery.
