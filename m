Subject: vmcore: allocate per-cpu crash_notes objects on page-size boundary

To satisfy mmap()'s page-size boundary requirement, allocate per-cpu
crash_notes objects on page-size boundary.

/proc/vmcore on the 2nd kernel checks if each note objects is allocated on
page-size boundary.  If there's some object not satisfying the page-size
boundary requirement, /proc/vmcore doesn't provide mmap() interface.
