Subject: ext4: use simple_prepare_write to zero page data
From: Nate Diller <nate.diller@gmail.com>

It's common for file systems to need to zero data on either side of a
write, if a page is not Uptodate during prepare_write.  It just so happens
that simple_prepare_write() in libfs.c does exactly that, so we can avoid
duplication and just call that function to zero page data.
