Subject: jbd2: only create debugfs and stats entries if cache initialisation is successful
From: "Duane Griffin" <duaneg@dghda.com>

jbd2 debugfs and stats entries should only be created if cache initialisation
is successful.  At the moment they are being created unconditionally which
will leave them dangling if cache (and hence module) initialisation fails.
