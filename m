Subject: w1: w1_io.c reset comments and msleep
From: David Fries <david@fries.net>

w1_reset_bus, added some comments about the timing and switched to msleep
for the later delay.  I don't have the hardware to test the sleep after
reset change.  The one wire doesn't have a timing = requirement between
commands so it is fine.  I do have the USB = hardware and it would be in
big trouble with 10ms interrupt trans= fers to find that the reset
completed.
